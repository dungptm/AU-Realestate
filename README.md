# Australia Real Estate
The project is an attemp to analysis the price of realestate and show results graphically. The intention is to give suggestions to people who are going to buy properties to live in or to invest. 

In the first step, I crawled all postcodes and all relevent info which could be used as index. Next, I crawled sold history from 'Realestate' and auction results from both 'Realestate' and 'Domain'. I am going to do data analysis and build website with Django and Bootstrap to demonstarate the results.

./Postcoeds is the codes used to crawl postcodes relevent information

./Realestate is the codes used to crawl sold history and auction results from 'Realestate' and 'Domain'
